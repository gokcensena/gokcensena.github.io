I am Gökçen Sena Duman, born and brought up in Turkey. Ever since I was a child, I had a passion for foreign languages. Over the years, this passion made me decide to pursue my career as a conference interpreter and translator. I graduated from the Department of Translation and Interpreting at Hacettepe University, one of the top-tier programmes of my field. Since 2016, I have been working as a simultaneous, consecutive, whispered and liaison intepreter. I aim to ensure effective and smooth communication by offering professional and reliable interpreting services.
